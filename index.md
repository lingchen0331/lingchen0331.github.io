## About Me

Welcome! I'm Chen Ling, a fourth-year Ph.D. student at [Emory University](https://www.cs.emory.edu/home/), where I am fortunately working with Professor [Liang Zhao](http://cs.emory.edu/~lzhao41/index.htm). I have obtained my M.S. Degree on Computer Science at the University of Delaware and B.S. Degree on Computer Science at the University of Vermont. 

In the realm of graph-based data mining, my work encompasses deep graph generation, graph representation learning, and graph inverse problems. On the other side, I'm deeply involved in customizing large language models to address specific challenges and opportunities in various domains.

I hold a strong academic background and have contributed to multiple research projects, constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the data science field. My works have been published at top AI conferences, including ICML, KDD, ICLR, ICDM, ECML-PKDD, TheWebConf (aka. WWW), and SDM.

I am actively looking for *research scientist* or *machine learning engineer* internship positions in <span style="color:lightpink;">Summer 2024</span>. Please feel free to reach out!
