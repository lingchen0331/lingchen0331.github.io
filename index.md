## About Me

Welcome! I'm Chen Ling, a dedicated researcher with a passion for solving real-world problems through data mining and machine learning. Based in Atlanta, Georgia, I specialize in two main areas: Data Mining on Graphs and Large Language Models.

In the realm of graph-based data mining, my work encompasses deep graph generation, graph representation learning, and graph inverse problems. On the other side, I'm deeply involved in customizing large language models to address specific challenges and opportunities in various domains.

I hold a strong academic background and have contributed to multiple research projects, constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the data science field. My works have been published at top AI conferences, including ICML, KDD, ICLR, ICDM, ECML-PKDD, TheWebConf (aka. WWW), and SDM. I'm always open to collaboration and new challenges, feel free to reach out!
