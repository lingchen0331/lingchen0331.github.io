## About Me

Welcome! I'm Chen Ling, a fourth-year Ph.D. student at [Emory University](https://www.cs.emory.edu/home/), where I am fortunately working with Professor [Liang Zhao](http://cs.emory.edu/~lzhao41/index.htm). Prior to that, I obtained my M.S. Degree in Computer Science at the University of Delaware and B.S. Degree in Computer Science at the University of Vermont. I have several research experience in industries, including [NEC Labs America](https://www.nec-labs.com/research/data-science-system-security/), [IBM Watson AI Lab](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/), and [iFlyTek](https://global.iflytek.com/).

My research encompasses Graph Mining, Natural Language Processing, and Applied Machine Learning. During the past few years, I am privileged to collaborate with amazing industry researchers from Amazon AWS, NEC Labs America, Microsoft Research, and IBM Research. My works have been published at top AI conferences, including ICML, KDD, ICLR, EMNLP, TheWebConf (aka. WWW), ICDM, ECML-PKDD, and SDM.

I have been actively looking for *research scientist* or *machine learning engineer* full-time positions in <span style="color:lightpink;font-weight:bold">Fall 2024</span>. Feel free to reach out if there are any opportunities!
